No need to take the reader when traveling. Simply open the app, download the book from my library, and it opens to the same page that was last shown on my Kindle. Next time I open either device it syncs and asks if I want to go to the last page read on the other device. Awesome! Functionally, the app seems to work just like my touch screen Kindle reader."

Actually four stars but temporarily 1 store for the following reason:  I'd like to report a rare bug which only affects a few users such as myself. I cannot find any link online (Via Google etc.) for a bug report system.  Bug: If you use multiple accounts, the in-app store for the Kindle Reader always points to the regional store associated with your single sign-on Amazon account, *not* the account you have registered your kindle reader with. This only effects the in-app store, but not the store your library actually is taken from. This means that if your single sign on is an account in a regional store that is different from the one you have your Kindle library on, you cannot make in-app purchases on your phone or device, but if you buy another book for the registered account via PC browser, it will still be synced to your phone. It is an inconvenience, but not a show stopper if you use Amazon on both Android device and PC."

Just to clarify, I didn't delete this book and this issue isn't a deal breaker, because Kindle books don't use much data, but I hope they fix this soon."

Instantly, pay online, download a book here in the app & start enjoying the reading right away! On this app, it's so easy to move on the pages, chapters, back & forth.
