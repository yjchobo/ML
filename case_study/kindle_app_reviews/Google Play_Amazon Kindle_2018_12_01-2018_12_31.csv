Ever since it had entirely ceased to work or sync and I lost all of my books even ones I had paid for across all devices (S8+ iPad 4 and a high end gaming pc win7 professional) . I deleted it and installed the original kindle app, this one here. It had resynced all of my data and worked for maybe a week. It has updated again and I have lost all of my books again across all devices. Even paid for books, the store wont load even on my high speed 5ghz wifi connection or full service 4gLTE cell service, so I cant even get back at LEAST the handful of unlimited books I have currently. Until Amazon can stop fixing what isn't broke and making everything worse I will be looking for another ebook app. I'm considering dropping all ties with Amazon totally. Every update reduces functionality and speed, becomes more complicated and clunky, and adds frustration across the board. Barnes and Noble + Netflix is looking to be the best option again for me. The convenience Amazon offers just doesn't seem worth it anymore."
