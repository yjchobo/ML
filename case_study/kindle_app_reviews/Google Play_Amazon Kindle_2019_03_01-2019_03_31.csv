I never before had this issue in the 5ish years using this app. I'm on a galaxy s8+. every minute I have to turn my screen back on. my phone is set to that. but normally the kindle app overrides that. that feature is no longer working. I do not know if this is an amazon problem or a samsung problem. in either case it's really annoying. my only option right now is turning my screen to never time out. that's not a good solution for me.
