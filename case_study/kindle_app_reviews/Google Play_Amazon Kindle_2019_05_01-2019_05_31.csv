With shelves, nice background. I dislike it when I go through the books and find one that I like and open it. When I close the book the app goes back up to the top instead of carrying on from where I was browsing. It's not bad but the developers can do better. Not happy the update did away with the downloaded items and all items. It's improved."

It's great to have access to books without having to carry them around in your bag. What I'm missing though is a way to show the actual page number of a book. I'm writing my thesis now and I don't see a way to cite properly, as page numbers are not showing, which sucks."
