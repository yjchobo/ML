"Reading books on devices are fine. I was having issues with ""Amazon Kindle has Stopped"" trying to Play the Narration on the Mobile (happens everytime I insall on new devces). Solution: copy/move the .axx file via android/data/com.amazon.kindle/files/audible/filename.aax to Download folder, then uninstall Kindle, then reinstall Kindle apk, sync and redownload book, then restart download of Audible Narrration until it locks in 1% of the download, then stop the download and close App, then go to Downloads folder and move back the .aax file to android/data/com.amazon.kindle/files/audible folder that would have at this time recreated itself (does not create via install), reopen Kindle and open book again, start download of Narration and wait until your Notification bar shows the book with play and or play comes up bottom-right in the book, then close Kindle and reopen. Done. Narration should view normal/complete and it will work the way it was intended. Review by Stryker's Lounge | +BJHutton",5,5/28/2018,0.048,0.079,0.856,0.066

"A reasonably good reader, in general. The one major flaw is not being able to move books to SD card, or set SD card as default storage location. Being able to select a download path for each download, or even setting one manually for everything (eg 128Gb SD card) would make this app dramatically better.  Still, it is how I get all of my digital manga. The problem being I can't keep a ton and have to delete stuff to download more. Very frustrating; If I have a large SD card, I'd like to be able to keep more of my library on it, instead of them filling up my internal storage and making my tablet and many of its other apps go nuts over space issues.",4,5/14/2018,-0.0442,0.063,0.872,0.065

"I love to read only one type of books, I read only one kind of books: Christian faith books. Since I live in India, it's impossible for me to get all the books authored by the foreign authors -- US, UK & others. And most of the books are not physical, hardcover but only Kindle version. And so I'm so blessed that I have Amazon Kindle -- such a great pleasure & blessing to read a lot of books on this app. Moreover, I don't have to order a book from the US, wait for around 20 days or more. Instantly, pay online, download a book here in the app & start enjoying the reading right away! On this app, it's so easy to move on the pages, chapters, back & forth.

"Amazon refuses to fix blank pages on the Kindle apps for Google Chrome Pixelbook laptop and Android tablets. Frustrating since I bought my books for reading on mobile devices. The blank screens on my Pixelbook only happen when it is in full screen display. If I use the scrolling smaller page display I can see the type but in a reduced size format. When I use my Samsung Android tablet it eventually starts displaying random black pages every other page. The only solution is to close Kindle and restart it. However, I lose my page setting and must find where I left off before the pages went black. You would think Amazon would fix their android/Chrome apps. But NO. They seem to have let their monopoly power go to their heads and no longer need care if can read the books you purchase since they are the only game in town.",1,5/14/2018,-0.3715,0.067,0.856,0.077

Dear kindle manager your application size is increasing day by day. Huge number of kindle users like me are using in their tab or mobile not in your kindle device so it cause crash on it.

"Saw the prime reading feature and thought it was worth a look into. Picked up a magazine which added itself to the library which cannot be removed despite being deleted. Deregistered devices to attempt to purge caches, checked content on web site where there is no mention of the title on my account and as a result no way to remove it. I assume the concept of borrowing a title is to promote selling a subscription to the magazine. However if borrowing a title just leads to a cluttered library of junk all it promotes is not using the feature. Will be avoiding the newsstand features and borrowing until a fix is out. Certainly won't trust it as a platform to preview content.",2,4/30/2018,-0.0521,0.075,0.848,0.077

"At present, Amazon to all appearances has REMOVED THE ABILITY TO ACCESS BOOKMARKS from the Android version of the Kindle app, except as part of a monolithic list of aggregated highlights, notes, and bookmarks. But since they've provided no means of filtering said list (really, they haven't), it pretty much negates the utility of bookmarks as a distinct category. And it's a pretty important distinct category.  Alas, there's no other way to read Kindle books so Amazon has no incentive to fix this.",1,6/25/2018,-0.8429,0.111,0.706,0.183

"Since last update one of my purchases books crashes moments after opening. I can read only a couple sentences at a time. It is a long book. I do have some highlights and bookmarks. A short book that I've only skimmed the far (no highlights, notes, or bookmarks) did not have issues. something about this book and the update is causing a big FAIL! I have dozens of hours invested in the book. I want to finish it, but cannot. What to do? closing all apps, and rebooting don't work. neither does reinstalling. Plus last time I reinstalled, I lost dozens of hours of highlights! So I'm not keen to do that again. especially with no assurance of a fix. wish I could reverse the update. or maybe I got to a page that is to big for tree app to handle, combined with the fact that I have highlights and bookmarks? dunno. but my purchase and time invested is down the drain until a fix is made.",3,6/25/2018,-0.8148,0.056,0.85,0.094

Amazon continues to troll Chrome users by not fixing the graphics rendering issue that makes reading ebooks in the Kindle app impossible on Chromebooks (Note to others: check out Calibre and Moon+). This is a widely reported bug (check all the reviews here that are from Chrome users). The Kindle Cloud reader UI is not useful for the annotations/highlighting/notes I make on the books I've bought for work (I'm an academic). I do not want to get stuck in the tech support feedback loop from hell yet again... I have done everything (reset, powerwash, reinstall, redownload everything multiple times - etc etc etc) to fix.

Not working now on Pixelbook. Getting blank pages or gobbledygook when in e read mode so unable to use at all. EDIT Mar15 2018 just got a note saying that the fix will not come until later in the spring when they an OS update is completed. EDIT JUNE 16 SPRING HAS COME AND GONE. AMAZON KNOWS THE PROBLEM EXISTS AND WE ARE GOING ON 4 MONTHS NOW THAT THEY HAVE LEFT US UNABLE TO READ BOOKS PURCHASED FROM THEM. THIS IS SO UNACCEPTABLE. So it seems that not being able to access one's library is of little concern or this would be a specific update asap.

"I was good with the app until I bought some comics. Even though I have the sd card as the storage to be used according to the apps screen of my Android, the app downloaded them to the internal storage and filled up my phone (several Star Wars comics). It seems that there was an option on the app itself that is no longer there.? I uninstalled the comics & figured I'd download them only to the new tablet I got. ...yeah. In the apps section I don't even have the option. My Nook app itself gives me the option & I had no problem saving books from B&N on my sd card (if book allows it). I tried to uninstall & re-install Kindle, but it still will only save to my internal storage & not give me sd/external storage as an option. On top of that, it won't let me ""rename my device"" to the name I had when I did the 1st download to the tablet. I get ""device taken"", it wants to rename my same device with each re-install (I did uninstall a 2nd time, & the 3rd will remain that way until this stupid thing is fixed). Maybe that's something that I have to go to Amazon to fix (rename issue), but if so, that's SUPER annoying.",3,6/11/2018,-0.9028,0.074,0.801,0.125

"So I really love the app, but I have a few suggestions. The default white background on digital readers is really hard on my eyes, and I imagine that others have the same problem, but I noticed it's kind of difficult to find where to change the background color. I found it, but it did take me a couple of days, so I suggest putting it in the main settings menu instead of the font menu inside the book. Also, I adore widgets as opposed to icons, so if you could possibly add a widget option in the next update that would be fantastic. Another thing that would be lovely is reading reminders. So many of us lead such busy lives that it's easy to forget that we have a book waiting for us. So some sort of daily notification to read our books would be great!",5,6/11/2018,0.9513,0.165,0.753,0.082

The Kindle app suddenly stopped working this morning. I use this every day. I'm in a bit of a panic. Please help!!! Anyone know if it's possible/how to roll back to a previous version? _________________ UPDATE 1: OK. Not sure how or why but I have the old version with all it's great features & none of the crappy features in the latest version. I'm so happy. I won't be turning on the auto update & will research the latest version before upgrading again. So I've changed my rating to 5 stars again. ___________________ UPDATE 2: I had to buy a new tablet so I'm seeing the version without the carousel for the first time. NOT COOL Amazon! Most of my home page being taken up with recommended books. The more I see these being shoved down my throat the less likely I'll buy any. Back down to 2 stars.,2,6/4/2018,0.9576,0.156,0.781,0.063

"Update as of 6/2 No longer crashes my tablet everytime, which is a step in the right direction, and load time is now only thirty seconds on average so its better, but now my books crash two or three times everytime I open them before finally stabilizing. Not a deal breaker, but still bloody annoying, especially given how smoothly the original version worked. Colour me frustrated but grudgingly tolerant... Was excellent, smoothly functional, elegantly designed, and a delight to use - before the update. Now the app crashes almost everytime I open it and even crashes my tablet about half the time, the carousel only shows a few books and the search function is clunky as hell, the load time is slow and jerky, the control panel is overly complicated and doesn't function as well as the original, and generally the entire app has been rendered useless by the ""updates"". I don't mind the aesthetic changes I suppose, though I don't see the need since the original was fine while unannounced and unrequested overhauls of this type of service feels heavy handed and inconsiderate. I'm all for innovation, but please have the courtesy to ask if its a paid service, and for the love of heaven KISS - that's Keep It Simple, Stupid. The technical difficulties are unacceptable and ridiculous - I paid for my books, a fair amount in fact, and part of the agreement my being able to read them. Amazon, please refund my money so I can buy hard copies or get the app into a working state. Dissapointed, with both the new app and Amazon's thoughtlessness toward their clients...",3,5/28/2018,-0.8634,0.181,0.622,0.197

"EDIT: OK, so I can tap that thing twice to turn it off. Maybe put it in the settings menu too.  I find the progress bar utterly annoying. Why would I have to be reminded of the estimated time to finish a chapter nonstop? Oh, my reading speed's dropped, better do something about that! I personally find even looking at page numbers distracting. With electronic books, we could finally not know when a book's going to end, so why not take this opportunity?  Besides that, it's a decent reading app. If I could turn off the progress bar I would be quite happy about it.",3,5/28/2018,0.9341,0.172,0.782,0.046

"I have 3 Android tablets that I use to read my Kindle books - plus a Kindle Paperwhite, (which I love, because it doesn't strain my eyes like my Tablets seem to do.) What drives me bonkers is, - the books are not syncing automatically across all my devices as they're supposed to. Yes!

"A tap/touch on (most areas of) the screen triggers a 'zoom out'. As an illustration, imagine most areas of your phone screen acting like the home button. So you're constantly zooming in / out -- or taking pains to touch ""carefully"" in the hopes of avoiding an unwanted zoom out. Quite annoying.

Moreover, my lists on amazone app are also broken (apparently it considers that i cannot buy eversions of books from abroad). Well, it takes a lot to try making the app completely unusable. Great kudos to clever guys who did it! Update 28.02.18. One more time return to dec 17 version. The store became again quite usable. Raised rating till 4 stars. Update 15.02.18. January version comeback. Store is unusable. Update 10.02.18. Returned to the previous version of the market and became again very usable. Raised rating till 4 stars. Please add the ability to use other dictionaries. Previous updates made this app more accessible, considering the access to the store. Recent update ruins all experience. The store, accessed from this app, is absolutely unfunctional. I can't even add the book to the wishlist. Moreover, the purchased status is not indicated. I should access every individual book in order to see the price. Please return to the previous version of the store accessed from the kindle app + add, if possible, the ability to visualise kindle wishlists directly from the app. Reading part is 80% good, but, please add the ability to use other dictionaries besides those provided by amazon.",1,7/30/2018,0.9203,0.11,0.859,0.031

Since the last updates this app has not gone directly to the kindle store to search new books, it also does not allow me to do the read for free with kindle unlimited without going on the amazon app. I also now have to go to the full website to return borrowed books. Its too much of a hassle that I wouldn't deal with but sadly addicted to reading. This just makes it that much harder to find books in my genre.",1,7/23/2018,-0.0592,0.068,0.869,0.063

"Amazon has decided to have Kindle Unlimited commit suicide by banning productive authors. Don't feed this troll. Don't invest in a collection of books by your favorite independent author on this platform, or they will be sure to make that author's life Hell. Look to content providers that actually care what their customers think. It is patently obvious that Amazon does not. This app would be amazing if it wasn't (lack of) supported by a former bookseller that has grown too big to listen. Thank you, Amazon.

"I was good with the app until I bought some comics. Even though I have the sd card as the storage to be used according to the apps screen of my Android, the app downloaded them to the internal storage and filled up my phone (several Star Wars comics). It seems that there was an option on the app itself that is no longer there.? I uninstalled the comics & figured I'd download them only to the new tablet I got. ...yeah. In the apps section I don't even have the option. My Nook app itself gives me the option & I had no problem saving books from B&N on my sd card (if book allows it). I tried to uninstall & re-install Kindle, but it still will only save to my internal storage & not give me sd/external storage as an option. On top of that, it won't let me ""rename my device"" to the name I had when I did the 1st download to the tablet. I get ""device taken"", it wants to rename my same device with each re-install (I did uninstall a 2nd time, & the 3rd will remain that way until this stupid thing is fixed). Maybe that's something that I have to go to Amazon to fix (rename issue), but if so, that's SUPER annoying.",3,7/23/2018,-0.9028,0.074,0.801,0.125

BEWARE OF TRAP..!!!! never buy from AMAZON It is a new strategy of Amazon by which they can loot your money. 1.) You will not receive your complete order ever. ( I ordered two v- gaurd stablizer received only one) ( I ordered one drill machine but received incomplete drill machine without bits) 2.) Then if you will complain will give every proof I received only one. they will sympathise you for your situation for 5 to 6 days. and will say we will investigate. 3.) They will investigate by merely sitting in their office so called specialist team. 4.) Will conclude ohhh sir we have sent you complete items its you have signed it on delivery paper. Its your fault. ( because after opening and checking the parcel the delivery person will say talk to Amazon people if you have received incomplete not my responsibility) 5.) Amazon specialist team will say we can't generate any refund any return. 6.) Oh sorry sir you have to return all the items whether you have received it or not. 7.) Sir case closed your money lost. Your product lost. You also get lost. Because we dont give a damn about how much items you received it or not.,1,7/23/2018,-0.9093,0.039,0.868,0.093

"Despite the many good features of this app, I am inclined to believe kindle as been configured to be bias. First and foremost, the majority of the book I purchased through kindle are of ethnic minority writers, however, all the suggestions I have received from this app is of European or other white background writer. I believe through my book choice it's quite clear am not interested in reading books with characters that do not look like me nor writers who like like their white characters. Representation is very important to me. Since the people behind these kind of app goes the extra mile to collect our data, at least, do it properly and give us suggestions of the books we have stored in our Kindle.

"I like the app but it has 2 flaws from my perspective. 1. I have to download the whole book.. and open it to be able to read the blurb. Not great when you have loads to choose from. 2. After having to uninstall and reinstall 3 times.. plus the app ""losing"" my book history twice. I realised it doesn't tell you which books you have read or % read unless you download and open. And then you have to open them one by one. ... yet amazon customer service knew and could tell me over the phone. Very disturbing.",3,7/16/2018,-0.9467,0.035,0.817,0.148

"What have you done? There were always a few limitations but now can't delete from the carousel and the app keeps crashing. Try to employ some people who know what they're doing. Awful update, has not improved the interface one bit. Can't believe the arrogance of the Kindle developers totally ignoring the huge number of bad reviews following the last update. Amazon listens to it's customers? Not in my experience. If there was an easy alternative to read my purchased books I'd be gone.

Bait and switch from amazon. I was offered free book to read when I was on their website if I use this app. I did. The book now shows $2.99. App is functional. I am just not about rewarding bad corporate behavior. Uninstalled.,1,7/9/2018,0.6217,0.176,0.762,0.062

Over all it is ok. I don't like the fact I can't return a book through the app and the fact I can't export (once past the point of being able to return) DRM free so I can use my preferred reader app. Also because you are locked into this app for books you buy through Amazon there is no way to organize my library in folders not to mention the lack of a simple builtin one click read out loud text feature that you find in apps like moon reader.,3,7/2/2018,-0.1331,0.077,0.83,0.093

"No log out button. Yes. You read that right. Apparently the app devs are such user unfriendly idiots that they don't even give you a log out button.

"A good reader app, this reads most everything in most every format. My biggest complaint is how large the file is. It would be nice if the developers can work on streamlining it to about 35 to 30 MB.",4,7/2/2018,0.5423,0.133,0.816,0.051
"Whatever you do, never enable 1-click purchase. I had this app on my phone for a while and read on it all the time. Then I made the mistake of turning on 1-click, and now I am the ""proud"" owner of over $50 in books I don't want, didn't order, and can't return. The app lags constantly in menus and if you ever tap remotly near where a ""buy now with 1-click"" button is located, it will buy the book, even if the button is on a previous page and hasn't registered that you left it, or is on the next page and it hasn't changed the screen yet. It also doesn't always tell you that it paid for the book, and the return instructions are years out of date and no longer apply, not to mention if it's a book you rented via unlimited and it makes you ""accidentally"" buy it it registers you as having completed the book and returning is not an option. Long story short NEVER ENABLE 1-CLICK.",1,7/2/2018,-0.7447,0,0.951,0.049
1 click buying cannot be disabled which presents a massive security flaw. People can just go onto your Kindle app and buy whatever as there is no password protection. What a total disgrace. Uninstall fast.,1,7/2/2018,-0.836,0.059,0.688,0.253

"Good for reading ebooks; although, the app downloads and stores images on the device (occupying space) for their sample comics, etc. Sure, such things are potentially helpful for new users, but once they're no longer needed, the user cannot permanently delete them without the app downloading them again. In addition, if the user has the Amazon Shopping app installed, the Kindle app automatically starts in the background. Again, this is helpful if you've purchased an ebook, but it needlessly occupies space in RAM if you aren't downloading new purchases.",3,7/2/2018,0.7543,0.116,0.855,0.029

This is a constant frustration with an easy fix. downgrading review. old review :They've finally added some of the features a leading book app should have so I've upped my rating. There are still some features missing like a simple page / location reset (the furthest read page is the end of the book-to reset that is complicated instead of a single, per-DEVICE touch).

I absolutely HATE the new update where your collections are in the front screen with all the rest of your books! You lose the 'what you're currently reading' book in the bottom of the screen and you have to go to 'uncollected' books to view ALL of your books!!! Change it back! This update was unnecessary as you could vote your collections of books from the drop-down menu already! This is making me rethink Kindle and go back to strictly paper form books!!! >:(,2,8/20/2018,-0.9231,0,0.867,0.133

"It would be really nice to have stats on how long a book took me to read or how much time I spent reading on a specific day. Audible does this for audio books!

That workaround didn't work for me and I wish I didn't even have to consider using a children's app for these types of stats to begin with.

Great app. Works well on both my iPad Pro and Android phone. Because I use it on two different platforms the sync function is a must and it works very well. Still there are some issues. I would like to see a completed book section similar to Apple's ibooks and easier formatting controls for magazines. The biggest issue is the Kindle app using battery in the background when you have logged out of Amazon. I usually do a Force stop when I get a notification on my phone that it's using battery.,4,8/13/2018,0.9022,0.162,0.815,0.023

"Finally evolving towards a workable way to manage digital content! With over 900 books in my library, I was delighted to see that when adding books to a category, the list of possibilities no longer includes books already IN that category! I would really appreciate being able to change the sort order of the possibilities between title/author/recent like you can the library itself, though. I also really wish it was possible to filter the library by multiple categories simultaneously (books categorized as ""nonfiction,"" ""reference,"" and ""dogs,"" for example). It would also be hugely useful to be able to *exclude* books by category (all books categorized as ""fiction"" but not categorized as ""romance,"" for example).",4,8/13/2018,0.789,0.092,0.894,0.014
"Updated for newest:  Well... bad to worse.  It can find Amazon to let me buy books.  No problem.  It just can't find the internet to download the same books.  Yet I can turn around and buy another book while it still can't find the net or download...   Interesting when it does download, it says it is downloading but doesn't download. Click download again and it downloads the book.  That's when it can find the Internet to actually download.  Super cluttered. It's more store than reading app.  Not very convenient for keeping track of the book you are reading.  The phrase I would use is an ""Ungodly mess.""   Congradulations, Amazon.

They've only problem with this app and it's a huge one is I can not CHOOSE to store book content on my SD card. My tablet has limited internal storage so I bought an SD card because the books I use are large file books and with basic apps on my tablet there is no room to download books that I read and study by daily. Moving books to my SD card would solve the problem but the app does not allow for this to be done. Please fix this. It's the whole reason I bought a tablet.,3,8/6/2018,-0.1899,0.061,0.849,0.09

"Kindle is really good with an Audible book, using Whispersync. That is where its advantage, ends. I have over 100 books on Kindle, so I have to use it. Every version of Kindle, whether for PC or Android, has absolutely horrific navigation, almost no choices you can make to customize it; that is not how it started, 10 years ago. Most of the Kindle books I own I bought back when it started, & it was great. But now? Awful. Plus, you can't read a Kindle item in some other reader. So you're stuck with Kindle. If I ever find an alternative, I'll take it. I only rarely Buy Kindle books now for that reason. Since Android covers up the characters while I talk, I'm stopping this review now.

I used Kindle for the first time. And it wasn't that good experience for me. Not at all user friendly. Book purchases is on credit card basis. Was unable to find any option easily. The rates are written in dollars whereas we purchase in Indian rupees. When u open details of the book there u'll see the converted amount of the book from dollars. I puchased one book it wasn't displaying in the library. Highly disappointing.,1,7/30/2018,0.3184,0.1,0.828,0.072

"I have had Kindle for years and I absolutely hate the new update. It is horrible, and I don't like the new homepage I don't like the fact that it's not black anymore. It was a lot easier on the eyes whenever you would turn it on after being asleep. I'm having a really hard time syncing my library back on to my phone. I had to deregister my device and then reregister it and now it's taking a long time to sync. Also I cannot find my download settings to change them if I need to, it's not giving me the option to download with or without Wi-Fi anymore or where I'm downloading my books to on my phone. Quick update, I had to go through and individually click on each book to redownload, since I had to re register. As I said I've had kindle for years, so I have 611 books I had to click on to download again!!!!!",2,7/30/2018,-0.9154,0.018,0.878,0.104

"Pretty good content selection for Prime members, but this apps functions and usability is mediocre. For instance, you can't easily return a book to the Prime library. The only way I've found to do that is to download a new book, and if you've got your limit, it prompts you to return a book first. So you constantly have to shuffle and exchange books as you browse. I suppose this isn't an issue if you buy the ebooks, but as tool to enjoy their Prime offerings, it's ridiculously cumbersome.",3,9/24/2018,0.4011,0.089,0.851,0.06

After been with them for long time spent lot of money for audio books and ebooks they become greedy and don't care about their loyal customer. .......you ask to purchase matching book but i have to pay again even already own the ebook....just because is an older version with the same content........ is just crazy and simply money grabbing. ......it should be automatically updated. ....,5,9/24/2018,-0.6266,0.03,0.852,0.118

The collections are not the same as on your Kindle, the navigation is absolutely rotten - you simply get lost and you spend ages to find the book you are currently reading - and the synchronisation doesn't work properly either.

"Update 06.09.18 Previous kindle store is back. Now there is no need to go to PC to search for the book. July version of the store was a horrible experience. Now i am very satisfied with the app. Update 28.07.18. Awfull variant of kindle book store is back. Why do you guys are destroying the experience so perseverently? Moreover, my lists on amazone app are also broken (apparently it considers that i cannot buy eversions of books from abroad). Well, it takes a lot to try making the app completely unusable. Great kudos to clever guys who did it! Update 28.02.18. One more time return to dec 17 version. The store became again quite usable. Raised rating till 4 stars. Update 15.02.18. January version comeback. Store is unusable. Update 10.02.18. Returned to the previous version of the market and became again very usable. Raised rating till 4 stars. Please add the ability to use other dictionaries. Previous updates made this app more accessible, considering the access to the store. Recent update ruins all experience. The store, accessed from this app, is absolutely unfunctional. I can't even add the book to the wishlist. Moreover, the purchased status is not indicated. I should access every individual book in order to see the price. Please return to the previous version of the store accessed from the kindle app + add, if possible, the ability to visualise kindle wishlists directly from the app. Reading part is 80% good, but, please add the ability to use other dictionaries besides those provided by amazon.",5,9/3/2018,0.9064,0.102,0.857,0.041

"It keeps on changing settings. Not all the setings are in one menu. The second, hidden setting menu is not at all intuitive to find. So you set your theme to dark and read and it is light. That is becaue the dark theme means nothing until you also change the hidden settings. The page curl turns on all the time, even if you HATE that junk. And, as you try to tap to advance a page it goes BACK a page. It is plagued with tons of small probles like selecting when trying to swipe. Really needs a lot of work to clean up these issues but it is the only way to read many Amazon things so you are stuck with it and they don't care.",3,9/3/2018,-0.6602,0.042,0.89,0.068

I want my shelf to only show the books not in a collection.  How the fricking hard is that?????   Also, cannot remove a book from the shelf that was borrowed from the library . .. . you have to go to your Amazon account to Device Digital Content, to remove it.

"I've never had an issue with any Kindle app or e-reader...until now. It doesn't work on the Note 9. Even tried the ""Kindle for Samsung"" app under Samsung Essentials and the results were worse as it only caused my phone to lock up. With each passing update I'll continue to check and see if the problems on the Note 9 have been resolved, but at this point I won't hold my breath waiting. I'll have to turn to Google's Play Books for my book reading needs when I don't have any of my Kindle devices on me. I will add this, other than the issues on the Note 9, I absolutely love Kindle. So to be clear, this review is strictly about the Kindle App on the Galaxy Note 9.",2,10/22/2018,0.9115,0.105,0.866,0.028

"The app's fine (although a little unreliable at times). However, I'm not prepared to give more than 2 stars to any app that prevents logging in using cut and paste.

"FINALLY YOU ARE LISTENING ! I started to AVOID this app and I can understand why people DRM-break books SO THEY CAN USE THEM ON OTHER READERS. (Didn't think of that, did you?).....FINALLY you have been LESS GREEDY by separating MY books from the SAMPLES - one big reason I STOPPED USING THE APP.  I am actually MORE likely to buy if I can see all my samples in one place, GREEDY ! I ALSO like that you can REORDER in collections - except this is very BUGGY. It keeps freezing. Now all you need to do is 1) STOP BEING GREEDY and allow the app to open on LIBRARY - I ALREADY SEARCH YOU FOR BOOKS OFTEN ENOUGH, GREEDY!  ISNT THAT ENOUGH GREEDY?  2) STOP BEING GREEDY and allow me to use the inbuilt TTS on my phone, like ALL OTHER APPS. GREED and SELFISHNESS do not serve you in the end.

It's glitchy as all hell. For some reason it wouldn't let me download a book until I bought and download another book. It kept saying I had reached the device limit and that I had to remove the book from my other device before I could download it to this one. I only have the app on my phone! It's also uninstalled some of my books for no reason. I didn't have to pay for them again but I did lose my page. I would recommend another app until they fix this one. Most people seem to be in agreement about that.,1,10/8/2018,0.3049,0.098,0.826,0.076

It's okay. Doesn't have as many free reads as I'd like. So I'm using an actual library app instead. I'm an occasional reader so 1-2 books a month is more than enough. But the ones I want to read are almost as expensive as buying the physical copy so I've opted to use something else.

On Android 8.0 my books no longer download properly and Amazon has neither fixed the problem or done anything to remedy my situation aside from giving basic suggestions like clearing my cache which I hasn't solved anything. It's been maybe 6 months or more of basically being locked out of my library that I only ever access on my phone and what's the point on my collection I paid for if i can't read it? I'd recommend buying through Google Books to avoid the potential compatibility issues the company simply doesn't to address.,1,10/1/2018,0.6303,0.116,0.82,0.064

Love the new interface and layout of the kindle app but only thing I hate is I can't access my docs and don't know how to access the cloud library because I won books from Amazon library and never gotten them. So what's the point of using this app if you can't use the docs section plus the app steals a massive amount of data like one time it was 900+ mb. I know this is a large app to consume data but it should steal so much. It is crazy. I can't uninstall it because the app came with my phone. Oh well.,5,11/26/2018,0.4641,0.168,0.697,0.135

So everyone out there having trouble since the latest update of the 7.4 Release, if you're having trouble it's not you. The update is causing it. I had a chat with Samsung, but didn't get any relief from them but to tell me I should upgrade my OS system. I will look into that.",1,11/19/2018,-0.5763,0.06,0.858,0.083

Unfortunately it lacks some feature I need and library management sucks. No default ""To Read"", ""Reading"", and ""Read"" shelves to keep library organized. No ability to delete books in app, has to be done from website. No quick way to add a book you find in the store to a default wishlist. No quick way to see book description from your library. No way to print out book notes and highlight or have them available in office document like Google Play Books does. And a big one, no epub support.

"There is glitches in the app. I subscribe to free e book emails. When I click on a free book it redirects me to the Kindle store, the book is listed as free. I click ""buy now for free"" and it borrows the book with my Kindle unlimited. I click ""buy for free"" again. It says this book is already borrowed and in your library. I return the book and try again. It borrows the book again. The deceptive part is when you click buy for free it gives you the same message as if you bought it. But it only borrowed it. So by the time you realize it's borrowed and not bought the book is no longer free. I've lost at least 30 free ebooks to this glitch. Tonight I had to click ""buy for free"" and return the book so many times it took 30 minutes to actually buy 4 free books. Please fix this glitch (or is it purposeful to keep us from getting free books) it just seems a little suspicious that the borrow screen and the purchased screen are identical. You have no idea it was borrowed and not purchased. So you eventually lose the free book. Sorry for the rant, love Kindle but very frustrated with this.

"It's a good companion for reading comic and manga ebooks for those without a Fire Kindle. But its apparent inability to keep a strong hold on all and any ebook downloaded is extremely irritating. Even if I had NOT explicitly asked the app to do so, I would often find that, on the next restart, some of the ebooks I had deliberately downloaded would disappear as if they were never downloaded in the first place. If you have to go off the grid, I suggest you use an ordinary ebook reader such as the Kindles or similar. Do NOT trust this app. It might ditch your downloaded ebooks at the most inconvenient moment.",1,11/12/2018,-0.9414,0.063,0.774,0.164

"I gave it 3 stars because while I like the app overall there are things that bother me. I have an android phone so I am not able to scroll through the books which is an inconvenience, especially when so many other reading apps allow you to scroll. Also, when you are trying to find a new book in the store. There are very limited filtering options so you are forced to look at so many books you do not want to. Genres are mixed with other things related to the book like whisper sync. So of you wanted to look up a scifi book that also have whisper sync you'll have to choose between one or the other and try to find the thing that you want through all the books that you know you do not want.",3,11/12/2018,-0.6277,0.048,0.854,0.098

"I like the fact that this app saves your place between devices. However, I'm docking a couple points for a couple reasons.  -Textbook functions are not easy to navigate.  -I don't like the fact that if you accidentally get to the end of your textbook it immediately kicks you out like you finished the book.  -Chromebook support is absolute trash. Amazon you ought to fix this. I used a kindle fire but that was such a horrible experience I just loaded it up with children's apps and gave it to my sister for her kid.   Because of how chromebook support is so bad, I might just start renting my digital textbooks from Google Play Books until it is fixed. I'd prefer to stick to amazon for digital rental of books, but even on my nice Chomebook Plus v2 the experience is pretty rough.",3,11/12/2018,0.7968,0.157,0.749,0.094

"I'm  using this app on my Likebook Mars, which uses e-ink. It handles the essentials, but it is not as good as a dedicated Kindle, and it lacks the customization options of a really good Android ereading app like Moon+Reader. It offers a selection of fonts, though the only one I find really suitable is Bookerly. My Kindle Touch and Moon+Reader both allow the use of sideloaded fonts. On my Kindle, I can go to a location with precision by typing in the exact page location I want to go to. With this app, I have to use a slider that moves me through a book in a jumpy, imprecise manner, then page to the location I want to go to after getting somewhere in its neighborhood. For some reason, selecting text is more difficult in this app than it is on my Kindle Touch. While some footnotes appear on the page, some do not. My Kindle has a helpful back arrow for going back to where I was, but the app doesn't. I can report content errors in my Kindle Touch but not in the app. Moon+Reader provides much smoother page turns than this app does. I don't want animated page turns on e-ink.",4,11/5/2018,-0.4511,0.083,0.834,0.083

"Although I like this app very much the 'GO TO' option doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy S9. When using the option I input a number then select page or location as appropriate, if page selected it advances 2 pages, if location then it advances but nowhere near the location requested. Contacted Amazon who told me to de-register the device, logout, uninstall then re-install the app and setup again. Did this but fault still occurring. Contacted Amazon who told me to install Kindle app from Amazon store but there isn't one. Tried the Samsung Kindle app with same error.

"Overall it is not a bad app for reading ebooks, my main issue is that the page count is always off. For instance, I recently read a novella that was only 117pages (which I counted), but Kindle said it was in the 500-page range. On top of that it skipped page numbers. So it would say that I am on page 122 but then the very next page would be 129. I don't know why it did that but it made it very irritating to have to count my own pages so I know how far actually was in the book. Lucky for me I was reading a novella and not a full-length novel. I will definitely not be reading a full-length novel in Kindle.",3,11/5/2018,0.2615,0.09,0.837,0.074

2) Subsequent to my rant all is sorted now and my Kindle is behaving itself over all my tech stuff. Thanks for that and I'm back to a four star rate and regard Kindle as the best of the bunch. 1) I loved this app but since someone has tinkered with it it will not allow me to open or access my books or give me any explanation why there is a problem.

"Overrated Poorly organized, hard to navigate books. Many icons are ""off screen"" and you have to figure which part of the empty areas of the screen to touch to get them to appear. This often leads to actions you don't want-like moving the page forward or back. Other actions, like returning to your library from a page in a book, are unneccessarily difficult. The library itself is poorly organized, titles are mixed with ""samples"". The user has to manually organize by ""collections"". Worst of all, are Amazon's ""number of devices allowed"" per title.

"Used kindle for samsung for several years up until Samsung stopped the free monthly book service and updated the app accordingly. Ever since it had entirely ceased to work or sync and I lost all of my books even ones I had paid for across all devices (S8+ iPad 4 and a high end gaming pc win7 professional) . I deleted it and installed the original kindle app, this one here. It had resynced all of my data and worked for maybe a week. It has updated again and I have lost all of my books again across all devices. Even paid for books, the store wont load even on my high speed 5ghz wifi connection or full service 4gLTE cell service, so I cant even get back at LEAST the handful of unlimited books I have currently. Until Amazon can stop fixing what isn't broke and making everything worse I will be looking for another ebook app. I'm considering dropping all ties with Amazon totally. Every update reduces functionality and speed, becomes more complicated and clunky, and adds frustration across the board. Barnes and Noble + Netflix is looking to be the best option again for me. The convenience Amazon offers just doesn't seem worth it anymore.",2,12/10/2018,0.567,0.093,0.831,0.076

This app leaves much to be desired. The look and feel is very cheap and clunky. There is a search function but its horrible. A company like kindle should have better features then this. If they don't have what your looking for at least suggest authers. You cannot favorite authers for easy search. I find it very hard to know if the book is part of a series and if so what number it is. Would be cool to see a tree of the series so I can gauge the content of the series in a visual format.

I suffer from migraines but I love to read. I love my kindle but I don't always have the opportunity to have it with me... not to mention I forget to charge it sometimes so I'm very thankful for the kindle app so I can read my books everywhere I take my phone. You have the option to change the colors if reading the normal way bothers you at all. I have my set with a black backdrop with white letters. It's amazing!!! I recommend the kindle and the kindle app to everyone that loves to read. Oh and BTW: I use to be a paper book snob until I started using my kindle. I literally have over a hundred books to choose from anywhere I am now.,5,12/10/2018,0.9873,0.255,0.687,0.057

Great app. I have used Kindle for years. I also love how they incorporated library loans as well. Makes it so much easier. One thing i woukd suggest is changing the brightness option to sliding your finger up and down on the left or right side so you don't have to use the menu to do so.,5,12/10/2018,0.944,0.247,0.753,0

I have a huge digital library and I regret my best option to use them across devises is Kindle and Audible. They have had all the data from day one yet still if I want even to see a summary on a book listed on cloud OR DEVISE I must exit out and go to another app. This is usually the store. How basic is picking up a book and turning it over to read the back details? Yet my so-called amazing technology is incapable of telling me anything about any of the books I own.

I really do not like the new format. I prefer the old carousell with sugested books in a small bar across the bottom and my currently installed books showing prominately across the middle of the screen. now my home screen is so busy and cramped. Why does the book I last read have to take up a third of my screen? It is a much less clean Interface than before.

"Lack of real page numbers for reference creates a nightmare for sharing information with peers & academic groups. I waste HOURS out of my week trying to guess what pages my instructors have assigned, and even for the few books that show page numbers in the upper corner, a different reference number is shown when you tap the page. It's a master cluster-**ck. Definitely never buy the electronic books for school or for any other kind of research. YOU WILL REGRET IT.",3,2/18/2019,-0.186,0.102,0.8,0.099

Today the app dumped all my catalog and is unable to sync or connect to the Kindle store. 2 hours working with customer service has led to many dead ends.

"I love my Kindle books. They make me happy. What is frustrating the fertilizer out of me is how often the app closes when I am trying to download my books. I have 2 new devices in the last 4 weeks: Samsung Tablet and a Galaxy Note 9. It took over 24 hours to download my books on the tablet because the app kept stopping. And the app is repeating itself with the Note. I have re-started, powered off, uninstalled the app, tried to download the books from my content and devices and the app stops.

"This is my reader of choice, and it gets steadily better, but lacks in in-depth customization options. Actually four stars but temporarily 1 store for the following reason:  I'd like to report a rare bug which only affects a few users such as myself. I cannot find any link online (Via Google etc.) for a bug report system.  Bug: If you use multiple accounts, the in-app store for the Kindle Reader always points to the regional store associated with your single sign-on Amazon account, *not* the account you have registered your kindle reader with. This only effects the in-app store, but not the store your library actually is taken from. This means that if your single sign on is an account in a regional store that is different from the one you have your Kindle library on, you cannot make in-app purchases on your phone or device, but if you buy another book for the registered account via PC browser, it will still be synced to your phone. It is an inconvenience, but not a show stopper if you use Amazon on both Android device and PC.",1,2/11/2019,-0.9593,0.046,0.844,0.11

"This is a great app for when I don't have my Kindle on me especially with the AMOLED display on my phone making the reading experience closer to the Kindle. One annoyance that I have encountered has caused me to drop my rating. This is the fact that after downloading my book that I am reading, a few days later, the book needs downloading again. Just to clarify, I didn't delete this book and this issue isn't a deal breaker, because Kindle books don't use much data, but I hope they fix this soon.",3,2/4/2019,0.6369,0.07,0.895,0.035

The only problem l have with this app is the ease in which accidental purchases can be made even without being aware of it. I therefore suggest that you introduce a purchase confirmation stage as a buffer against this potentially costly and time-consuming mishap. The brief cancellation option period whilst downloading is simply inadequate.,4,3/25/2019,-0.5574,0.045,0.809,0.146

"While this is technically my favorite and most used app, I find it very sketchy that the purchase and information buttons are located in such a way to make accidental purchases possible, which I have done on several occasions when I really only wanted to read the description on sample books. I see the info link and move to click on it, only to have the bar suddenly scroll down and now it's a purchase button.

An additional suggestions I hope to see someday: Ability to see the amount of hours you read each book/or the total hours. Similar to the Reading Insight page in the settings.

I have used the Kindle app for years and loved it. Bought a new book several days ago and it would not complete the download. Spent a couple of hours trying to download it. Finally gave up. Went to read a book I had successfully downloaded a month ago and found I had lost half of that book and another book i had successfully downloaded no longer was available. SO SO FRUSTRATED. Searched Google and i am not alone. The Amazon Kindle BUG needs fixed!!!!!!!I guess I won't be buying books from Kindle,1,3/11/2019,-0.8719,0.114,0.698,0.188

Since I got my reliable kindle keyboard (that I'm still using) I've wanted to see a genre sort method. I have thousands of books in my library and I may remember I purchased an interesting book but can't remember the title or author. Sorting by genre would cut the amount of titles to search through considerably. Most of the time I don't get beyond the B's before I get frustrated and quit. Would also be nice to be able to quickly link to book descriptions.,3,4/22/2019,-0.4019,0.064,0.853,0.084

To start with the app for me took really (really) long to start up this is an issue that needs to change. Also wham I was scrolling across it took incredibly long to go on to the next book this also needs to be changed. Finally when I tried to sign in to my amazon account it wouldn't let me so I contacted amazon. And all they told me was power off my phone switch it back on and try again when this didn't work I once again got in contact with them and they said delete the app and download it again then try again. This didn't work so I definitely do not recommend this app so download google play books it is much better,1,4/15/2019,0.8536,0.096,0.888,0.016

Love all it can do that I forgot to mention. If you like to read, this is your app to read while waiting for your name to be called in the Waiting Room. Millions of free books has opened a whole new world of amazingly talented YA authors. Built in dictionary, audio reader, speed reading features with the vocabulary builder and included flash cards. Golly there's so much more that I've forgot to mention. I use the bajeezus outta this app on my cell, my paperwhite, my Fire and my boyfriends Galaxy. Check books out from my library in town and my notes and highlights can be emailed to me in pdfs or spreadsheet formats. Can share my books with my friends,!!

"Updated! The app keeps crashing. I'm using a brand new Samsung S5e. I only have Amazon video, and nothing else on the tablet. I don't have any games, or other junk on the tablet, and the thing just keeps crashing. Update. The crash happens when first opening the app, and it's loading in recommendations. While it's doing this, immediately open the current book at the bottom of the page. When the book opens, go to the upper left and open the library. This seems to be the only way to get it work.",1,5/27/2019,-0.6696,0.018,0.927,0.055
