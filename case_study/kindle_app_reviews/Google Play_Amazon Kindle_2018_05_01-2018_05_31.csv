I was having issues with ""Amazon Kindle has Stopped"" trying to Play the Narration on the Mobile (happens everytime I insall on new devces). Solution: copy/move the .axx file via android/data/com.amazon.kindle/files/audible/filename.aax to Download folder, then uninstall Kindle, then reinstall Kindle apk, sync and redownload book, then restart download of Audible Narrration until it locks in 1% of the download, then stop the download and close App, then go to Downloads folder and move back the .aax file to android/data/com.amazon.kindle/files/audible folder that would have at this time recreated itself (does not create via install), reopen Kindle and open book again, start download of Narration and wait until your Notification bar shows the book with play and or play comes up bottom-right in the book, then close Kindle and reopen. Done. Narration should view normal/complete and it will work the way it was intended. Review by Stryker's Lounge | +BJHutton"

Still, it is how I get all of my digital manga. The problem being I can't keep a ton and have to delete stuff to download more. Very frustrating; If I have a large SD card, I'd like to be able to keep more of my library on it, instead of them filling up my internal storage and making my tablet and many of its other apps go nuts over space issues."

Since I live in India, it's impossible for me to get all the books authored by the foreign authors -- US, UK & others. And most of the books are not physical, hardcover but only Kindle version. And so I'm so blessed that I have Amazon Kindle -- such a great pleasure & blessing to read a lot of books on this app. Moreover, I don't have to order a book from the US, wait for around 20 days or more. Instantly, pay online, download a book here in the app & start enjoying the reading right away! On this app, it's so easy to move on the pages, chapters, back & forth. Thankfully, they provide amazing discounts of 70%, 50%, 80%, 30%, etc etc. It's such a great joy to have this app."

Frustrating since I bought my books for reading on mobile devices. The blank screens on my Pixelbook only happen when it is in full screen display. If I use the scrolling smaller page display I can see the type but in a reduced size format. When I use my Samsung Android tablet it eventually starts displaying random black pages every other page. The only solution is to close Kindle and restart it. However, I lose my page setting and must find where I left off before the pages went black. You would think Amazon would fix their android/Chrome apps. But NO. They seem to have let their monopoly power go to their heads and no longer need care if can read the books you purchase since they are the only game in town."

Picked up a magazine which added itself to the library which cannot be removed despite being deleted. Deregistered devices to attempt to purge caches, checked content on web site where there is no mention of the title on my account and as a result no way to remove it. I assume the concept of borrowing a title is to promote selling a subscription to the magazine. However if borrowing a title just leads to a cluttered library of junk all it promotes is not using the feature. Will be avoiding the newsstand features and borrowing until a fix is out. Certainly won't trust it as a platform to preview content."

Is there really any reason in hell why you can't download a simple sample directly from within the program!? Why should you have to go online opening a web browser to download a simple sample or even purchase!? What's the purpose of having this app if you can't do everything you need to within the app?
