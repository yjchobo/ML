Recently when they update the ebooks I lose access to audible material that I have purchased and have to call in get the updated book with the audiobook. The sync feature should have some method of resolving this issue. I have already spent money on the Audible feature and losing access because of a bug is frustrating.

I also really wish it was possible to filter the library by multiple categories simultaneously (books categorized as ""nonfiction,"" ""reference,"" and ""dogs,"" for example).

I can't download all of my books because it keeps eating so much of my internal memory that it's impossible for me to keep my books on my phone. I refuse to purchase another phone just to be able to download some books. Keep the app on internal memory send the rest to sd card. Annoying.

Moving books to my SD card would solve the problem but the app does not allow for this to be done. Please fix this. It's the whole reason I bought a tablet.

Google Play,English,8/3/2018,com.amazon.kindle,Amazon Kindle,2.02E+13,Amazon Mobile LLC,,7.0.0.49,3,,"The app is becoming rather heavy and bloated, and it takes up a great deal of space on tiny old phones like mine. One of the last updates also created images of a number of dictionaries showing up among my books, and I would have preferred if these dictionaries were hidden in the background. But being ever-present annoyed me. Also some of the newer features, like page flipping, are very slow on my device. I have now reinstalled and older version of the app that works much better than the newer ones. It's a strange case of the old being better than the new!"
Google Play,English,8/3/2018,com.amazon.kindle,Amazon Kindle,2.02E+13,Amazon Mobile LLC,,8.9.0.72,2,,"Kindle is really good with an Audible book, using Whispersync. That is where its advantage, ends. I have over 100 books on Kindle, so I have to use it. Every version of Kindle, whether for PC or Android, has absolutely horrific navigation, almost no choices you can make to customize it; that is not how it started, 10 years ago. Most of the Kindle books I own I bought back when it started, & it was great. But now? Awful. Plus, you can't read a Kindle item in some other reader. So you're stuck with Kindle. If I ever find an alternative, I'll take it. I only rarely Buy Kindle books now for that reason. Since Android covers up the characters while I talk, I'm stopping this review now. I can't see what I'm doing."

Also I cannot find my download settings to change them if I need to, it's not giving me the option to download with or without Wi-Fi anymore or where I'm downloading my books to on my phone.
