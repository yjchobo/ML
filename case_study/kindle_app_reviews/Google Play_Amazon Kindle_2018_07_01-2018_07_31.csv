Look to content providers that actually care what their customers think. It is patently obvious that Amazon does not.

Even though I have the sd card as the storage to be used according to the apps screen of my Android, the app downloaded them to the internal storage and filled up my phone (several Star Wars comics). It seems that there was an option on the app itself that is no longer there.? I uninstalled the comics & figured I'd download them only to the new tablet I got. ...yeah. In the apps section I don't even have the option. My Nook app itself gives me the option & I had no problem saving books from B&N on my sd card (if book allows it). I tried to uninstall & re-install Kindle, but it still will only save to my internal storage & not give me sd/external storage as an option. On top of that, it won't let me ""rename my device"" to the name I had when I did the 1st download to the tablet. I get ""device taken"", it wants to rename my same device with each re-install (I did uninstall a 2nd time, & the 3rd will remain that way until this stupid thing is fixed). Maybe that's something that I have to go to Amazon to fix (rename issue), but if so, that's SUPER annoying."

You will not receive your complete order ever. ( I ordered two v- gaurd stablizer received only one) ( I ordered one drill machine but received incomplete drill machine without bits) 2.) Then if you will complain will give every proof I received only one. they will sympathise you for your situation for 5 to 6 days. and will say we will investigate. 3.) They will investigate by merely sitting in their office so called specialist team. 4.) Will conclude ohhh sir we have sent you complete items its you have signed it on delivery paper. Its your fault. ( because after opening and checking the parcel the delivery person will say talk to Amazon people if you have received incomplete not my responsibility) 5.) Amazon specialist team will say we can't generate any refund any return. 6.) Oh sorry sir you have to return all the items whether you have received it or not. 7.) Sir case closed your money lost. Your product lost. You also get lost. Because we dont give a damn about how much items you received it or not.

I don't like the fact I can't return a book through the app and the fact I can't export (once past the point of being able to return) DRM free so I can use my preferred reader app. Also because you are locked into this app for books you buy through Amazon there is no way to organize my library in folders not to mention the lack of a simple builtin one click read out loud text feature that you find in apps like moon reader.

I had this app on my phone for a while and read on it all the time. Then I made the mistake of turning on 1-click, and now I am the ""proud"" owner of over $50 in books I don't want, didn't order, and can't return. The app lags constantly in menus and if you ever tap remotly near where a ""buy now with 1-click"" button is located, it will buy the book, even if the button is on a previous page and hasn't registered that you left it, or is on the next page and it hasn't changed the screen yet. It also doesn't always tell you that it paid for the book, and the return instructions are years out of date and no longer apply, not to mention if it's a book you rented via unlimited and it makes you ""accidentally"" buy it it registers you as having completed the book and returning is not an option. Long story short NEVER ENABLE 1-CLICK."

In addition, if the user has the Amazon Shopping app installed, the Kindle app automatically starts in the background. Again, this is helpful if you've purchased an ebook, but it needlessly occupies space in RAM if you aren't downloading new purchases."
