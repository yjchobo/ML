For instance, you can't easily return a book to the Prime library. The only way I've found to do that is to download a new book, and if you've got your limit, it prompts you to return a book first. So you constantly have to shuffle and exchange books as you browse. I suppose this isn't an issue if you buy the ebooks, but as tool to enjoy their Prime offerings, it's ridiculously cumbersome."

Google Play,English,9/5/2018,com.amazon.kindle,Amazon Kindle,2.02E+13,Amazon Mobile LLC,,8.10.0.116,1,,By far the worst app ever..constantly underperforms. It never loads in less than two minutes whereas google books is up and ready in 10-20 seconds. Constantly advises me book is corrupt and that i need to remove it and then reload it. I let it sit for 2 minutes and then i can read untill the next hissy fit it has. I hate navigating this app but that could be that google books is so user friendly..basically the kindle app frustrates me and uses up far to much of my precious freetime.
