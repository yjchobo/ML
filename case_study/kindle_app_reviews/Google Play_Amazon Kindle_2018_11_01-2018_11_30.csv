So everyone out there having trouble since the latest update of the 7.4 Release, if you're having trouble it's not you. The update is causing it.

When I click on a free book it redirects me to the Kindle store, the book is listed as free. I click ""buy now for free"" and it borrows the book with my Kindle unlimited. I click ""buy for free"" again. It says this book is already borrowed and in your library. I return the book and try again. It borrows the book again. The deceptive part is when you click buy for free it gives you the same message as if you bought it. But it only borrowed it. So by the time you realize it's borrowed and not bought the book is no longer free. I've lost at least 30 free ebooks to this glitch. Tonight I had to click ""buy for free"" and return the book so many times it took 30 minutes to actually buy 4 free books. Please fix this glitch (or is it purposeful to keep us from getting free books) it just seems a little suspicious that the borrow screen and the purchased screen are identical. You have no idea it was borrowed and not purchased. So you eventually lose the free book. Sorry for the rant, love Kindle but very frustrated with this.

It gets more and more unusable every time they force an update on us.   I've even had a Kindle Fire (you'd think it would work well on a Fire, wouldn't you?) and it didn't work well on that either.  On my current (new) tablet it takes a few minutes to even open and another few minutes to be ready to read a book.   It's turned into a slow, bloated monstrosity by trying to be too much and too fancy.  They really need an option to turn off the bloat and let us choose to have a simple reading app because this thing is bad."

But its apparent inability to keep a strong hold on all and any ebook downloaded is extremely irritating. Even if I had NOT explicitly asked the app to do so, I would often find that, on the next restart, some of the ebooks I had deliberately downloaded would disappear as if they were never downloaded in the first place. If you have to go off the grid, I suggest you use an ordinary ebook reader such as the Kindles or similar. Do NOT trust this app. It might ditch your downloaded ebooks at the most inconvenient moment."

Genres are mixed with other things related to the book like whisper sync. So of you wanted to look up a scifi book that also have whisper sync you'll have to choose between one or the other and try to find the thing that you want through all the books that you know you do not want."

Amazon you ought to fix this. I used a kindle fire but that was such a horrible experience I just loaded it up with children's apps and gave it to my sister for her kid.   Because of how chromebook support is so bad, I might just start renting my digital textbooks from Google Play Books until it is fixed.

It handles the essentials, but it is not as good as a dedicated Kindle, and it lacks the customization options of a really good Android ereading app like Moon+Reader. It offers a selection of fonts, though the only one I find really suitable is Bookerly. My Kindle Touch and Moon+Reader both allow the use of sideloaded fonts. On my Kindle, I can go to a location with precision by typing in the exact page location I want to go to. With this app, I have to use a slider that moves me through a book in a jumpy, imprecise manner, then page to the location I want to go to after getting somewhere in its neighborhood. For some reason, selecting text is more difficult in this app than it is on my Kindle Touch. While some footnotes appear on the page, some do not. My Kindle has a helpful back arrow for going back to where I was, but the app doesn't. I can report content errors in my Kindle Touch but not in the app. Moon+Reader provides much smoother page turns than this app does. I don't want animated page turns on e-ink."

For instance, I recently read a novella that was only 117pages (which I counted), but Kindle said it was in the 500-page range. On top of that it skipped page numbers. So it would say that I am on page 122 but then the very next page would be 129. I don't know why it did that but it made it very irritating to have to count my own pages so I know how far actually was in the book. Lucky for me I was reading a novella and not a full-length novel. I will definitely not be reading a full-length novel in Kindle."
