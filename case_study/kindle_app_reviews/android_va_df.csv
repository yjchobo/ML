Solution: copy/move the .axx file via android/data/com.amazon.kindle/files/audible/filename.aax to Download folder, then uninstall Kindle, then reinstall Kindle apk, sync and redownload book, then restart download of Audible Narrration until it locks in 1% of the download, then stop the download and close App, then go to Downloads folder and move back the .aax file to android/data/com.amazon.kindle/files/audible folder that would have at this time recreated itself (does not create via install), reopen Kindle and open book again, start download of Narration and wait until your Notification bar shows the book with play and or play comes up bottom-right in the book, then close Kindle and reopen. Done. Narration should view normal/complete and it will work the way it was intended.

Even though I have the sd card as the storage to be used according to the apps screen of my Android, the app downloaded them to the internal storage and filled up my phone (several Star Wars comics). It seems that there was an option on the app itself that is no longer there.? I uninstalled the comics & figured I'd download them only to the new tablet I got. ...yeah. In the apps section I don't even have the option. My Nook app itself gives me the option & I had no problem saving books from B&N on my sd card (if book allows it). I tried to uninstall & re-install Kindle, but it still will only save to my internal storage & not give me sd/external storage as an option. On top of that, it won't let me ""rename my device"" to the name I had when I did the 1st download to the tablet. I get ""device taken"", it wants to rename my same device with each re-install (I did uninstall a 2nd time, & the 3rd will remain that way until this stupid thing is fixed).

Also, I adore widgets as opposed to icons, so if you could possibly add a widget option in the next update that would be fantastic. Another thing that would be lovely is reading reminders.

Anyone know if it's possible/how to roll back to a previous version? _________________ UPDATE 1: OK. Not sure how or why but I have the old version with all it's great features & none of the crappy features in the latest version. I'm so happy. I won't be turning on the auto update & will research the latest version before upgrading again. So I've changed my rating to 5 stars again. ___________________ UPDATE 2: I had to buy a new tablet so I'm seeing the version without the carousel for the first time. NOT COOL Amazon!

3339,"Update as of 6/2 No longer crashes my tablet everytime, which is a step in the right direction, and load time is now only thirty seconds on average so its better, but now my books crash two or three times everytime I open them before finally stabilizing. Not a deal breaker, but still bloody annoying, especially given how smoothly the original version worked. Colour me frustrated but grudgingly tolerant... Was excellent, smoothly functional, elegantly designed, and a delight to use - before the update. Now the app crashes almost everytime I open it and even crashes my tablet about half the time, the carousel only shows a few books and the search function is clunky as hell, the load time is slow and jerky, the control panel is overly complicated and doesn't function as well as the original, and generally the entire app has been rendered useless by the ""updates"". I don't mind the aesthetic changes I suppose, though I don't see the need since the original was fine while unannounced and unrequested overhauls of this type of service feels heavy handed and inconsiderate. I'm all for innovation, but please have the courtesy to ask if its a paid service, and for the love of heaven KISS - that's Keep It Simple, Stupid. The technical difficulties are unacceptable and ridiculous - I paid for my books, a fair amount in fact, and part of the agreement my being able to read them. Amazon, please refund my money so I can buy hard copies or get the app into a working state.

3743,"I was good with the app until I bought some comics. Even though I have the sd card as the storage to be used according to the apps screen of my Android, the app downloaded them to the internal storage and filled up my phone (several Star Wars comics). It seems that there was an option on the app itself that is no longer there.? I uninstalled the comics & figured I'd download them only to the new tablet I got. ...yeah. In the apps section I don't even have the option. My Nook app itself gives me the option & I had no problem saving books from B&N on my sd card (if book allows it). I tried to uninstall & re-install Kindle, but it still will only save to my internal storage & not give me sd/external storage as an option. On top of that, it won't let me ""rename my device"" to the name I had when I did the 1st download to the tablet. I get ""device taken"", it wants to rename my same device with each re-install (I did uninstall a 2nd time, & the 3rd will remain that way until this stupid thing is fixed).

( I ordered two v- gaurd stablizer received only one) ( I ordered one drill machine but received incomplete drill machine without bits) 2.) Then if you will complain will give every proof I received only one. they will sympathise you for your situation for 5 to 6 days. and will say we will investigate. 3.) They will investigate by merely sitting in their office so called specialist team. 4.) Will conclude ohhh sir we have sent you complete items its you have signed it on delivery paper. Its your fault. ( because after opening and checking the parcel the delivery person will say talk to Amazon people if you have received incomplete not my responsibility) 5.)

So since I cannot read anything or understand any of it when it's in french, it's useless to me. Tip to everyone: dont download while already on vacation in a foreign place because you will never get rid of that language.","['super', 'frustration', 'i', 'download', 'this', 'app', 'while', 'on', 'vacation', 'in', 'france', 'and', 'even', 'though', 'my', 'amazon', 'language', 'is', 'english', 'and', 'my', 'country', 'is', 'set', 'to', 'canada', 'the', 'app', 'is', 'constantly', 'in', 'french', 'i', 'can', 't', 'change', 'it', 'to', 'english', 'and', 'have', 'tried', 'deactivating', 'and', 'reactivating', 'the', 'device', 'and', 'that', 'does', 'nothing', 'so', 'since', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'read', 'anything', 'or', 'understand', 'any', 'of', 'it', 'when', 'it', 's', 'in', 'french', 'it', 's', 'useless', 'to', 'me', 'tip', 'to', 'everyone', 'dont', 'download', 'while', 'already', 'on', 'vacation', 'in', 'a', 'foreign', 'place', 'because', 'you', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'rid', 'of', 'that', 'language']",1,2018-08-20,-0.1531,0.059,0.876,0.065

7844,"Update 06.09.18 Previous kindle store is back. Now there is no need to go to PC to search for the book. July version of the store was a horrible experience. Now i am very satisfied with the app. Update 28.07.18. Awfull variant of kindle book store is back. Why do you guys are destroying the experience so perseverently? Moreover, my lists on amazone app are also broken (apparently it considers that i cannot buy eversions of books from abroad). Well, it takes a lot to try making the app completely unusable. Great kudos to clever guys who did it! Update 28.02.18. One more time return to dec 17 version. The store became again quite usable. Raised rating till 4 stars. Update 15.02.18. January version comeback. Store is unusable. Update 10.02.18. Returned to the previous version of the market and became again very usable. Raised rating till 4 stars. Please add the ability to use other dictionaries. Previous updates made this app more accessible, considering the access to the store. Recent update ruins all experience. The store, accessed from this app, is absolutely unfunctional. I can't even add the book to the wishlist. Moreover, the purchased status is not indicated. I should access every individual book in order to see the price. Please return to the previous version of the store accessed from the kindle app + add, if possible, the ability to visualise kindle wishlists directly from the app. Reading part is 80% good, but, please add the ability to use other dictionaries besides those provided by amazon.","['update', 'previous', 'kindle', 'store', 'is', 'back', 'now', 'there', 'is', 'no', 'need', 'to', 'go', 'to', 'pc', 'to', 'search', 'for', 'the', 'book', 'july', 'version', 'of', 'the', 'store', 'was', 'a', 'horrible', 'experience', 'now', 'i', 'am', 'very', 'satisfied', 'with', 'the', 'app', 'update', 'awfull', 'variant', 'of', 'kindle', 'book', 'store', 'is', 'back', 'why', 'do', 'you', 'guys', 'are', 'destroying', 'the', 'experience', 'so', 'perseverently', 'moreover', 'my', 'lists', 'on', 'amazone', 'app', 'are', 'also', 'broken', 'apparently', 'it', 'considers', 'that', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'eversions', 'of', 'books', 'from', 'abroad', 'well', 'it', 'takes', 'a', 'lot', 'to', 'try', 'making', 'the', 'app', 'completely', 'unusable', 'great', 'kudos', 'to', 'clever', 'guys', 'who', 'did', 'it', 'update', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'return', 'to', 'dec', 'version', 'the', 'store', 'became', 'again', 'quite', 'usable', 'raised', 'rating', 'till', 'stars', 'update', 'january', 'version', 'comeback', 'store', 'is', 'unusable', 'update', 'returned', 'to', 'the', 'previous', 'version', 'of', 'the', 'market', 'and', 'became', 'again', 'very', 'usable', 'raised', 'rating', 'till', 'stars', 'please', 'add', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'use', 'other', 'dictionary', 'previous', 'update', 'made', 'this', 'app', 'more', 'accessible', 'considering', 'the', 'access', 'to', 'the', 'store', 'recent', 'update', 'ruins', 'all', 'experience', 'the', 'store', 'accessed', 'from', 'this', 'app', 'is', 'absolutely', 'function', 'i', 'can', 't', 'even', 'add', 'the', 'book', 'to', 'the', 'wishlist', 'moreover', 'the', 'purchase', 'status', 'is', 'not', 'indicated', 'i', 'should', 'access', 'every', 'individual', 'book', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'see', 'the', 'price', 'please', 'return', 'to', 'the', 'previous', 'version', 'of', 'the', 'store', 'accessed', 'from', 'the', 'kindle', 'app', 'add', 'if', 'possible', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'visualise', 'kindle', 'wishlists', 'directly', 'from', 'the', 'app', 'reading', 'part', 'is', 'good', 'but', 'please', 'add', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'use', 'other', 'dictionary', 'besides', 'those', 'provided', 'by', 'amazon']",5,2018-09-03,0.9064,0.102,0.857,0.041

It handles the essentials, but it is not as good as a dedicated Kindle, and it lacks the customization options of a really good Android ereading app like Moon+Reader. It offers a selection of fonts, though the only one I find really suitable is Bookerly. My Kindle Touch and Moon+Reader both allow the use of sideloaded fonts. On my Kindle, I can go to a location with precision by typing in the exact page location I want to go to. With this app, I have to use a slider that moves me through a book in a jumpy, imprecise manner, then page to the location I want to go to after getting somewhere in its neighborhood. For some reason, selecting text is more difficult in this app than it is on my Kindle Touch. While some footnotes appear on the page, some do not. My Kindle has a helpful back arrow for going back to where I was, but the app doesn't. I can report content errors in my Kindle Touch but not in the app. Moon+Reader provides much smoother page turns than this app does.

So it would say that I am on page 122 but then the very next page would be 129. I don't know why it did that but it made it very irritating to have to count my own pages so I know how far actually was in the book. Lucky for me I was reading a novella and not a full-length novel.

Ever since it had entirely ceased to work or sync and I lost all of my books even ones I had paid for across all devices (S8+ iPad 4 and a high end gaming pc win7 professional) . I deleted it and installed the original kindle app, this one here. It had resynced all of my data and worked for maybe a week. It has updated again and I have lost all of my books again across all devices. Even paid for books, the store wont load even on my high speed 5ghz wifi connection or full service 4gLTE cell service, so I cant even get back at LEAST the handful of unlimited books I have currently. Until Amazon can stop fixing what isn't broke and making everything worse I will be looking for another ebook app. I'm considering dropping all ties with Amazon totally. Every update reduces functionality and speed, becomes more complicated and clunky, and adds frustration across the board. Barnes and Noble + Netflix is looking to be the best option again for me.

Actually four stars but temporarily 1 store for the following reason:  I'd like to report a rare bug which only affects a few users such as myself. I cannot find any link online (Via Google etc.) for a bug report system.  Bug: If you use multiple accounts, the in-app store for the Kindle Reader always points to the regional store associated with your single sign-on Amazon account, *not* the account you have registered your kindle reader with. This only effects the in-app store, but not the store your library actually is taken from. This means that if your single sign on is an account in a regional store that is different from the one you have your Kindle library on, you cannot make in-app purchases on your phone or device, but if you buy another book for the registered account via PC browser, it will still be synced to your phone. It is an inconvenience, but not a show stopper if you use Amazon on both Android device and PC.","['this', 'is', 'my', 'reader', 'of', 'choice', 'and', 'it', 'gets', 'steadily', 'better', 'but', 'lacks', 'in', 'in', 'depth', 'customization', 'option', 'actually', 'four', 'stars', 'but', 'temporarily', 'store', 'for', 'the', 'following', 'reason', 'i', 'd', 'like', 'to', 'report', 'a', 'rare', 'bug', 'which', 'only', 'affects', 'a', 'few', 'users', 'such', 'as', 'myself', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'any', 'link', 'online', 'via', 'google', 'etc', 'for', 'a', 'bug', 'report', 'system', 'bug', 'if', 'you', 'use', 'multiple', 'accounts', 'the', 'in', 'app', 'store', 'for', 'the', 'kindle', 'reader', 'always', 'points', 'to', 'the', 'regional', 'store', 'associated', 'with', 'your', 'single', 'sign', 'on', 'amazon', 'account', 'not', 'the', 'account', 'you', 'have', 'registered', 'your', 'kindle', 'reader', 'with', 'this', 'only', 'effects', 'the', 'in', 'app', 'store', 'but', 'not', 'the', 'store', 'your', 'library', 'actually', 'is', 'taken', 'from', 'this', 'means', 'that', 'if', 'your', 'single', 'sign', 'on', 'is', 'an', 'account', 'in', 'a', 'regional', 'store', 'that', 'is', 'different', 'from', 'the', 'one', 'you', 'have', 'your', 'kindle', 'library', 'on', 'you', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'in', 'app', 'purchase', 'on', 'your', 'phone', 'or', 'device', 'but', 'if', 'you', 'buy', 'another', 'book', 'for', 'the', 'registered', 'account', 'via', 'pc', 'browser', 'it', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'sync', 'to', 'your', 'phone', 'it', 'is', 'an', 'inconvenience', 'but', 'not', 'a', 'show', 'stopper', 'if', 'you', 'use', 'amazon', 'on', 'both', 'android', 'device', 'and', 'pc']",1,2019-02-11,-0.9593,0.046,0.844,0.11
