I can read only a couple sentences at a time. It is a long book. I do have some highlights and bookmarks. A short book that I've only skimmed the far (no highlights, notes, or bookmarks) did not have issues. something about this book and the update is causing a big FAIL! I have dozens of hours invested in the book. I want to finish it, but cannot. What to do? closing all apps, and rebooting don't work. neither does reinstalling. Plus last time I reinstalled, I lost dozens of hours of highlights! So I'm not keen to do that again. especially with no assurance of a fix. wish I could reverse the update. or maybe I got to a page that is to big for tree app to handle, combined with the fact that I have highlights and bookmarks? dunno. but my purchase and time invested is down the drain until a fix is made."

Amazon continues to troll Chrome users by not fixing the graphics rendering issue that makes reading ebooks in the Kindle app impossible on Chromebooks (Note to others: check out Calibre and Moon+). This is a widely reported bug (check all the reviews here that are from Chrome users). The Kindle Cloud reader UI is not useful for the annotations/highlighting/notes I make on the books I've bought for work (I'm an academic). I do not want to get stuck in the tech support feedback loop from hell yet again... I have done everything (reset, powerwash, reinstall, redownload everything multiple times - etc etc etc) to fix.

Getting blank pages or gobbledygook when in e read mode so unable to use at all. EDIT Mar15 2018 just got a note saying that the fix will not come until later in the spring when they an OS update is completed. EDIT JUNE 16 SPRING HAS COME AND GONE. AMAZON KNOWS THE PROBLEM EXISTS AND WE ARE GOING ON 4 MONTHS NOW THAT THEY HAVE LEFT US UNABLE TO READ BOOKS PURCHASED FROM THEM. THIS IS SO UNACCEPTABLE. So it seems that not being able to access one's library is of little concern or this would be a specific update asap. See Google Chromebook forum for more details

In the apps section I don't even have the option. My Nook app itself gives me the option & I had no problem saving books from B&N on my sd card (if book allows it). I tried to uninstall & re-install Kindle, but it still will only save to my internal storage & not give me sd/external storage as an option. On top of that, it won't let me ""rename my device"" to the name I had when I did the 1st download to the tablet. I get ""device taken"", it wants to rename my same device with each re-install (I did uninstall a 2nd time, & the 3rd will remain that way until this stupid thing is fixed).

The default white background on digital readers is really hard on my eyes, and I imagine that others have the same problem, but I noticed it's kind of difficult to find where to change the background color. I found it, but it did take me a couple of days, so I suggest putting it in the main settings menu instead of the font menu inside the book. Also, I adore widgets as opposed to icons, so if you could possibly add a widget option in the next update that would be fantastic. Another thing that would be lovely is reading reminders. So many of us lead such busy lives that it's easy to forget that we have a book waiting for us. So some sort of daily notification to read our books would be great!"

Would Not want to be reading too long on a mobile phone - even this one, which is a Galaxy S5 with a 5in Screen. Stick with a 7 inch or larger Screen on a Tablet and you'll be OK - especially if you want to view a Magazine. I use an Asus with @ 8 'n' a bit inch screen and it's better than my Original Version Kindle with its grey screen Ever was ! Enjoy, but remember to Download Everything to a Mem Card, or Up to the Free Amazon Cloud. I'd also suggest that you Start a Folder System by Genre or Author to Store your E-Books - especially when Amazon usually have Deals on Books for 99p/99c, and you just can't miss out on such a Bargain! 🤗Peace,Luv&Happiness 2 All 😉! ☘☘Pod🍀"

Not sure how or why but I have the old version with all it's great features & none of the crappy features in the latest version. I'm so happy. I won't be turning on the auto update & will research the latest version before upgrading again. So I've changed my rating to 5 stars again. ___________________ UPDATE 2: I had to buy a new tablet so I'm seeing the version without the carousel for the first time. NOT COOL Amazon! Most of my home page being taken up with recommended books. The more I see these being shoved down my throat the less likely I'll buy any. Back down to 2 stars.

Not a deal breaker, but still bloody annoying, especially given how smoothly the original version worked. Colour me frustrated but grudgingly tolerant... Was excellent, smoothly functional, elegantly designed, and a delight to use - before the update. Now the app crashes almost everytime I open it and even crashes my tablet about half the time, the carousel only shows a few books and the search function is clunky as hell, the load time is slow and jerky, the control panel is overly complicated and doesn't function as well as the original, and generally the entire app has been rendered useless by the ""updates"". I don't mind the aesthetic changes I suppose, though I don't see the need since the original was fine while unannounced and unrequested overhauls of this type of service feels heavy handed and inconsiderate. I'm all for innovation, but please have the courtesy to ask if its a paid service, and for the love of heaven KISS - that's Keep It Simple, Stupid. The technical difficulties are unacceptable and ridiculous - I paid for my books, a fair amount in fact, and part of the agreement my being able to read them.

I find the progress bar utterly annoying. Why would I have to be reminded of the estimated time to finish a chapter nonstop? Oh, my reading speed's dropped, better do something about that! I personally find even looking at page numbers distracting. With electronic books, we could finally not know when a book's going to end, so why not take this opportunity?  Besides that, it's a decent reading app. If I could turn off the progress bar I would be quite happy about it."

What drives me bonkers is, - the books are not syncing automatically across all my devices as they're supposed to. Yes! I have tried to sync them manually, but they still insist that I'm reading from a page - or a book that I've completed, no matter what I do. It's extremely annoying - Fix it Amazon Kindle, because I'm constantly buying books from you and I deserve better."
