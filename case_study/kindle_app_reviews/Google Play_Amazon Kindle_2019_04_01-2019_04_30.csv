Also wham I was scrolling across it took incredibly long to go on to the next book this also needs to be changed. Finally when I tried to sign in to my amazon account it wouldn't let me so I contacted amazon. And all they told me was power off my phone switch it back on and try again when this didn't work I once again got in contact with them and they said delete the app and download it again then try again. This didn't work so I definitely do not recommend this app so download google play books it is much better

Just getting it to give me a TOC while I'm in a book instead of starting the page flip thing is a pain. Also, the store has books in genre categories, why can't the app? The Collections feature is all but useless, having to manually sort books. My libary numbers in the thousands. I to tell Kindle to show me the scifi/history/cookbooks automatically instead of spending a decade doing the sorting myself. :("
